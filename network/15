to make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85
we add "46.19.122.85    intra.42.fr" to the file "/etc/hosts"


it becomes like that :
10.23.1.1       cdn.42.fr
10.23.1.1       cdn.intra.42.fr
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
46.19.122.85    intra.42.fr
